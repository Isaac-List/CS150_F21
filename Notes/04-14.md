# Working with Files in Python
## Part II: Outputting to Files

## Problem to consider: Data storage

When we run a program, any data created or modified while the program is running
is lost once the program terminates.

So, we must store data outside of the program (i.e. within a file)

## Tiered Architecture

Layers of a software system, which divide domains of usage
 - Application
 - Data
 - Network/system
 
We work within the top two layers in this class (applicaiton and data).

# Working with files in Python

### Opening a file
 - if file is in the same directory as the Python file: `file = open("filename.txt", "r")`
 (to read) or `file = open("filename.txt", "w")` (to write)
 - if file is not in the same directory, give the relative path

#### Example of Relative Directory
```python
file = open("../mydata/data2.txt")
```

Relative Path:
 - .. moves up a directory
 - / indicates entering a subdirectory (so Desktop/photos is the path to a photos folder on the desktop)
 
### Closing a file
When you are done working with a file, "close" it (similar to "saving" in word or other program)
`file.close()`

### Reading a File
Using a for loop:
```python
f = open("file.txt", "r")
for line in f:
    print(line)
f.close()
```

Using methods of the file object (readline, readlines, read)
```python
# readline() reads a single line
f = open("file.txt", "r")
line = f.readline()
f.close()

# readlines() reads entire file, each line is a string in a list of strings
f = open("file.txt", "r")
all_lines_list = f.readlines()
f.close()

# read() reads entire file, saves as a single string
f = open("file.txt", "r")
all_lines_string = f.read()
f.close()
```

### `with` Operator
```python
with open("filename", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
        
# No f.close() necessary
```

### Writing to a file

Use the `f.write("some string value\n")` operation
