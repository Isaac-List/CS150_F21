## Python Modules

 - Pieces of software which can be used by anyone in their own programs
 - Contain functions to be used for some specific purpose
   - Math functions
   - Data visualization

### Using Python Modules - Turtle
```python
# Import the turtle module
import turtle

# Create an object of the turtle.Screen class
wn = turtle.Screen()
# Create an object of the turtle.Turtle class
zoe = turtle.Turtle()

def draw_line(first_pix, degree, last_pix):
    """Move turtle forward, turn, and forward"""
    # Access the methods of the turtle.Turtle class object, which we have named "zoe"
    zoe.forward(first_pix)
    zoe.right(degree)
    zoe.forward(last_pix)

# Call the function, give it three values
draw_line(57, 35, 94)
```

### Math (Module)
```python
import math

def square_root(number):
    return math.sqrt(number)

my_number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(square_root(my_number))
```

### Random
```python
import random

# Generate a random number of any size
prob = random.random()
print(prob)

# Generate a random int between 1 and 7 (not including 7)
diceThrow = random.randrange(1, 7)
print(diceThrow)

```
